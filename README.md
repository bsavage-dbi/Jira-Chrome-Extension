* Jump to Jira issue in your current tab by entering the issue number or selecting from the dropdown and pressing 'enter' or by clicking the 'Run' button

## Installation

Clone repo into any directory.

In Chrome:

* go to manage your extensions: chrome://extensions
* enable 'Developer Mode', found in the top right corner of the page
![Developer Mode link](docs/images/enable_developer_mode.png "Developer Mode")
* click 'Load unpacked extension...'
* navigate to the *jiraExtension* directory
* click 'Select'

## Upgrading to newer version

Simply pull down the new version (git pull), go to manage your extensions (chrome://extensions), and press the 'Reload' link: ![Reload link](docs/images/reload.png "Reload")


## Troubleshooting

### Trying to reload I get 'Error Loading Extension' message
![Error Loading Extension](docs/images/error_loading_ext.png "Error Loading Extension")
This occurs when there has been a major change.  The extension is (most likely) working just fine, but you need to delete it and re-add it.
